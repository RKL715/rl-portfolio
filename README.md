## Inspirations

Here's a list of codepen, portfolio and website that inspired my portfolio :

* https://p5aholic.me/ (Keita Yamada) || Love the minimalistic design, good repartition of elements, the breathability of the page. (But I think there's too much blank space on the middle part in widescreen)
* https://codepen.io/matmarsiglio/pen/pojoPR (Matteo Marsiglio) || Love the colors schemes, soft animation, and minimalistic design. (But contrast is not enough for the text, needed something more accessible)
