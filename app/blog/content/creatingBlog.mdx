## Creating a Blog

| *This is a blog post about creating a blog. It's a bit meta, but it's a good way to learn about the process of creating a blog.*

I wanted to create a blog-like part in my portfolio. To share about my projects, and mostly, about my learning process.
Since my portfolio was made with React with VITE, I had some issues to make it work.
I wanted to use markdown files to write my posts, and I wanted to use the frontmatter to get the title, date, and other information about the post.
But, React with VITE wasn't the perfect match for this. It was hard to automate the process of getting the markdown files and parsing them to the blog page.
I managed to import and parse them manually, one by one, by naming them individually in the import statement. But it wasn't the best solution.
I wanted to automate this process, to make it easier to add new posts. So I decided to use Next.js to create the blog part of my portfolio.

### \- Why ?
Because I found that Next.js has a great feature called `getStaticProps` that allows you to fetch data at build time. So I can fetch the markdown files and parse them to the blog page at build time. This way, I can automate the process of adding new posts.
I just have to add a new markdown file in the posts folder, and it will be automatically added to the blog page.

### \- How ?

1. First, I had to migrate my React portfolio to Next.js. I created a new Next.js project and copied the files from the React project to the Next.js project.
2. I had already created a `posts` folder in the React project, so I copied it to the Next.js project. Actually, this post was created before having the whole blog thing working.
3. Then, I created a `getPosts` function to fetch the markdown files from the posts folder.
4. I used the `gray-matter` library to parse the markdown files and get the frontmatter.
5. I created a `Blog` component to display the posts.
6. I used the `getStaticProps` function to fetch the posts at build time.
7. I used the `Link` component from Next.js to link to the blog page.
8. I used the `useRouter` hook to get the `slug` of the post and display the post content.
9. I used the `remark` and `remark-html` libraries to parse the markdown content to HTML.
10. I used the `react-markdown` library to display the HTML content.

And that's it! Now I have a blog in my portfolio.
*Of course, I still need to style the whole thing, but that's not the hardest.*
