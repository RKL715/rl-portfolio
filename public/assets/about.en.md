Hi, I'm **RÃ©my**, a **front-end** web **developer**. <br />
You're on my **portfolio**, where I **showcase** my **projects**. <br />
I mostly **work** with **React**, **TypeScript** and **SASS**, on **WebStorm** <br /> 
I'm also a **photography** and **cinema** enthusiast, using **Affinity Photo**, **Affinity Designer** and **Premiere Pro**.

I was a **sociocultural animator** for 10 years, which allowed me to develop my **communication**, **project management** and **creativity** skills. <br />
I also **supported** people with **digital illiteracy** towards their **digital autonomy**. <br />
The **closure** of the **association** where I worked was an opportunity for me to **redirect** my professional career towards **development**. <br />

Passionate about **computers** since my first **amiga 500**, I **discovered** **web development** in high school, with **HTML** and **CSS**. <br />
My **career choices** led me **away** from this path, but I **always** kept an **eye** on **web** **evolutions**. <br />
Today, I **fully dedicate** myself to it, with **enthusiasm** and **determination**. <br />
**Graduated** by **OpenClassroom** in **front-end development**, I'm **ready** to **take on** **new challenges**. <br />
